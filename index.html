        <h2>LG Creative Designs</h2>

        <p>Being creative is who I am, and that is why I love being a graphic designer. It’s the process that inspires me. I enjoy taking a vision and creating something spectacular. My passion for design becomes evident with the final result.</p>
        <p>As a designer, I specialize in visual identity graphic design to create assets like logos, typography, color palettes, image libraries, and style guides that represent a brand’s personality. I feel it is imperative to ensure brand consistency by creating design elements that are suitable across all visual media.</p>

          <p>Vicious Cycles is a website project that I produced during my WEB 140 class at Wake Tech. I created the logo, chose the color palette, fonts, and contributed to the content.  All web page design was created by myself as part of the project.</p>
